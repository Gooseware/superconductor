# swarm-execute
Executes the given track using the Swarm Orchestrator. 
Accepts a track ID, loads the topography map, and orchestrates implementors and quorum reviewers to complete the track plan.

## Usage
`superconductor swarm-execute <track-id>`

This command replaces the older monolithic loop and allows targeted execution of individual tracks.

## Phase Gate Reviewer Prompt Template

When dispatching Phase Gate reviewers, you MUST include the following in their prompt:

### Shenanigan Checklist
You MUST check for ALL of the following shenanigans before reporting PASS:
1. Phantom implementation (stubbed code presented as complete)
2. Test Theatre (tests that pass regardless of implementation — check enum values, check actual types)
3. Silent Degradation (error paths that swallow failures — check every .catch() and try/catch)
4. Coverage Map Gaming (plan.md claims coverage of areas with no corresponding code changes)
5. Confidence Washing (vague success logs that fire regardless of actual outcome)
6. Dependency Laundering (side effects hidden through transitive imports)
7. State Machine Bypass (direct state mutation instead of using transition())
8. Hardcoded Results (values like `allGreen: true` that ignore actual computation)

### Execution Mandate
You are FORBIDDEN from reporting PASS based on static reading alone.
You MUST either run `npm test` or write a /tmp edge-case script and execute it.
Paste the terminal output as execution evidence in your findings.

### Plan-Gap Protocol
Before finalizing your verdict, grep plan.md for [x] items and cross-reference against `git diff --name-only`.
Any [x] AC with no corresponding file change = automatic [blocking] finding.
